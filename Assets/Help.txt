<size=120>SCRAMBLE</size>
- Scrambles the cube randomly
- Press the play button to solve

<size=120>RESET</size>
- Returns the cube to its original solved position

<size=120>RECOLOR</size>
- Allows you to color the cube
- Right-click on a face to color that face
- Use keyboard keys to change the color
	- W -> <color=White>White</color>
	- R -> <color=Red>Red</color>
	- B -> <color=Blue>Blue</color>
	- O -> <color=Orange>Orange</color>
	- G -> <color=Green>Green</color>
	- Y -> <color=Yellow>Yellow</color>
- Be careful - the solver doesn't check to make sure you entered a valid cube configuration (yet). It will attempt to solve it even though it cannot be solved which yields undefined behaviour.
- Press the play button to solve

<size=120>SLOW DOWN</size>
- Slow down how fast the cube rotates

<size=120>BACK</size>
- Goes back one step in the solution

<size=120>PLAY</size>
- Start or resume playing the solution

<size=120>PAUSE</size>
- Pause the solution

<size=120>NEXT</size>
- Go to the next step in the solution

<size=120>SPEED UP</size>
- Speed up how fast the cube rotates

<size=120>ALGORITHM</size>
- Currently the cube uses a beginner algorithm that solves the cube in about 120 moves
- Steps:
	1. Create the white cross
	2. Place the white corners
	3. Puts the 2-faced red, blue, orange and green blocks in their places
	4. Creates the yellow cross
	5. Puts the yellow cross in correct position
	6. Puts the yellow corners in the correct positions
	7. Orients the yellow corners
